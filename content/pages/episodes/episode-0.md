## Introduction

Our hosts Philip P. Arnold and Sandy Bigtree set up the podcast Mapping the Doctrine of Discovery

## Primary Questions

### What is the impact of the Doctrine of Discovery not only in the past but also the present?

*   Steve Newcomb clarifies that it is the Doctrine of Christian of Discovery and Domination

### Statues of Columbus statutes serving as monuments to the Doctrine of Discovery

*   [Onondaga Nation Statement on Columbus Statue in Downtown Syracuse](https://www.onondaganation.org/news/2020/onondaga-nation-statement-on-columbus-statue-in-downtown-syracuse/)

#### Need photos of the Columbus Statue

#### Definition

The Doctrine of Discovery is Discovery is a series of Papal Bulls (decrees with legal status) which further fused European Churches and Crowns together creating a theological and legal
justification for enslavement of Muslims (then called Saracens) and Indigenous peoples around the world starting in West Africa. It also justifies the extraction of natural resources from Mother Earth for the benefit of Popes and Princes. Finally it allowed for the exploitation of Mother Earth, the natural world, and all peoples. These Papal Bulls would fuse together into an effective short hand called the Doctrine of Discovery. in 1823 in the United States Chief Justice Johnson v. M'intosh relies on the Christian theological and legal precedence of the Doctrine of Discovery to justify the theft of Indigenous lands. The Doctrine of Discovery is still being used by settler-colonial courts like the U.S. as recently as 2005 when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made reference to the Doctrine of Discovery in  Sherrill V. Oneida (2005) and then again by Justice Neil Gorsuch in the 2020 McGirt v. Oklahoma decision. James Carroll in *Constantine's Sword* notes that the effective element of the Doctrine of Discovery was to forge Christianity into a weapon of colonization.

The Doctrine of Discovery is a theological tool of oppression and of Christian Hegemony, destructive capital and endless warfare.

### Repudiations

We have a list of repudiations of the Doctrine of Discovery issued by faith communities. One of the most important is the World Council of Churches repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery. Repuidations are the first step of moving towards rescinding the Doctrine of Discovery and moving towards better relationships

### Why does the DoD matter for the humanities at large?
